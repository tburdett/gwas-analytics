# Database Queries for GWAS Analysis

## Get all Studies

SELECT DISTINCT(PUBMED_ID) FROM STUDY ORDER BY PUBMED_ID

## Get all Studies and their traits

SELECT s.PUBMED_ID, e.URI, e.TRAIT
FROM STUDY s
JOIN STUDY_EFO_TRAIT se ON s.id = se.STUDY_ID
JOIN EFO_TRAIT e ON se.EFO_TRAIT_ID = e.ID
ORDER BY pubmed_id

## Get all Studies and the SNPs they have identified

SELECT DISTINCT s.PUBMED_ID, snp.RS_ID
